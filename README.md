## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS Variables 

### What I learned

In this project I learned about CSS variables and how to update them with JavaScript.


The following CSS snippet is used to set the variables:
```css
:root {
    --main-color: #006854;
    --blur: 10px;
    --spacing: 10px;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to use CSS variables in a larger project where I do not have a starter code.  

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - CSS Variables](https://css-tricks.com/updating-a-css-variable-with-javascript/) - This helped me understand how to use Javascript to update CSS variables.
